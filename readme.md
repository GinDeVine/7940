##   A genetic algorithm in Common Lisp

It's a genetic algorithm, which tries to reach a goal string from a generation of random strings (with the same length as the goal string) by crossing two strings or mutating a single character. It works well on small strings, but may use quite some time at larger ones.
The code is probably messy, inefficient and bad, as this is my first attempt at using CL.
